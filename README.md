# Jab
Jab is a source generator for C# utilizing the new [source generator](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/source-generators.md) features of the Roslyn Compiler. 
It takes care of automatically generating some of the most common and tedious boilerplate code needed for doing dependency injection in C#/.NET (particularly Aspnet Core).
Namely:

* Contructors that simply take a bunch of dependencies as parameters and store them in class fields or properties
* Service registrations (e.g. `services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>()`)
* Interfaces that mirror concrete implementation types (i.e. automatic creation of interfaces for given classes based on their public members)
* *More to come...*

## Constructor Generation
Given the following code:
```
public partial class MyService
{
  [Jab] public IDep1 Dep1 { get; }
  [Jab] public ILogger Logger { get; }
}
```
Jab will automatically generate the following constructor:
```
public partial class MyService
{
  public MyService(IDep1 Dep1, ILogger<MyService> Logger)
  {
    this.Dep1 = Dep1;
    this.Logger = Logger;
  }
}
```

## Service Registration
Simply apply the appropriate attribute (`[Transient]`,`[Scoped]`, or `[Singleton]`) to your service and Jab will automatically add it to a generated extension method that can be used to register all services in the assembly.
For example, given the following code:
```
[Transient] 
public class Service1 : IService1 { }

[Singleton]
public class Service2 : IService2, IService3 { }
```
Jab will generate the following:
```
public static IServiceCollection Jab(this IServiceCollection services) => services
  .AddTransient<Service1, Service1>()
  .AddTransient<IService1, Service1>()
  .AddSingleton<Service2, Service2>()
  .AddSingleton<IService2, Service2>()
  .AddSingleton<IService3, Service2>();
```
which you can use in your `Startup.cs` or whatever:
```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
  services.Jab();
  //...
}
```

## Automatic Interfaces
Simply declare that a type implements an interface with the same name and a prefix "I" and if that interface doesn't exist at compile time, Jab will automatically generate it based on the public members of the class. The interface will be made to inherit from any other interfaces the class inherits from, including automatically generated interfaces of base classes.

Given (where IMyService isn't defined):
```
public class MyService : IMyService, ISomethingElse
{
    public void DoSomething();
}
```
Jab will generate:
```
public interface IMyService : ISomethingElse
{
    void DoSomething();
}
```


## Why "Jab"?
The idea for the name comes from a conversation I overhead where a friend was asking another friend "have you been jabbed yet?" meaning "have you recieved a covid-19 vaccine yet?".
That made me think of "jab" as a fun, short, and apt synonym for "inject". That made it a good candidate for the name for `[Jab]` attribute since `[Inject]` was already taken (Blazor), and it was nice an short (nobody wants to type `[AutomaticallyInjectInContructor]`).
